1.深度优先搜索 DFS
2.宽度优先搜索 BFS
3.树与图的存储
4.树与图的深度优先遍历
5.树与图的宽度优先遍历
6.拓扑结构


DFS 执着  stack  O(N)      不具有最短性  算法思路奇怪 空间要求高
BFS 稳重  queue  O(2 ^ N)  最短路 最短的

边权都是1时用BFS

dp 和 最短路 互通

dp 是没有环的最短路

树是特殊的图 是无环连通图
有向图 a->b
无向图 a<-->b

有向图才有拓扑序列
有向无环图也叫拓扑图




As is vividly revealed in the picture, the child has been addmisson by college which is choiced by his mom, but the picture reminds me of one word which came from mostly parents in China is "It's all for you own good".

 Undoubtedly, We can benefit a lot from our parent's experience to avoid some lost, but maybe as a adult who was admited by college, from my view, it's time to allow childs forward to what he wants. To begin with make chioce by themself, the choice by himself means to judge, think, decision, learn to choose independently, no doubt for childeren' later life was benefit. Furthermore, "To be, or not to be, that is a question", as long as a child who want to or must to be a adult, he will made endless choice in his remain time, and no doubt with responsbliity that what we choices means to what we have. Therefore, when it comes to the key to indenpendent adults, the most important thing lies in made choice indenpendently.

 In a word, independent choices make people more mature, only in this way can we really grow;
